# NorCPM/Analysis/lib contains data assimilation code and input data for NorCPM

## Codes
- EnKF-official_V1: Data assimilation(EnKF), averaging model data(ensave) and interpolate observations(prep_obs).
- micom_ensemble_init: Code for adjust MICOM/BLOM data to avoid crash due to data assimilation.

### Config files
- EnKF-official_V1/make.inc
- micom_ensemble_init/build/Makefile.config

### Build
The Makefile do everything. Binaries will go to WORKSHARED/bin.

## Input data
### Observation
- Now NorCPM only support EN4 and HadISST2. Should place in NorCPM/Analysis/lib/WORKSHARED/Obs in one month per file.
- EN4 data also need representive error files. Check the WORKSHARED/Input/NorESM/f19_tn14/needfiles.txt.

### Model climatology
- Model climatology is necessary for anomaly data assimilation. Usually use a historical run to generate it. See NorCPM/Analysis/lib/files/README for more detail.
- The files should be at WORKSHARED/Input/NorESM/f19_tn14.
